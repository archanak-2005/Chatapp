## 🚀 What is ChatApp?

ChatApp is a real-time **private messaging app** where users can join with a username and chat **privately** with another user in real time.

✅ Unlike group chats or public broadcasts, only the **intended recipient** sees the message.

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. User enters their **username**
2. Specifies the **recipient's username**
3. Sends a message
4. Only the **recipient receives** the message – private and instant

🔁 Powered by **Socket.IO** for real-time communication.
